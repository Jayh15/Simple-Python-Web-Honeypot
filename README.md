# Simple-Python-Web-Honeypot
This honeypot runs a fake admin login web server using only Python's built-in HTTP server. It logs login attempts along with GeoIP information (city, region, country, ISP) to a text file. It blocks repeated login attempts from the same IP and shows a fake file manager page upon login.
